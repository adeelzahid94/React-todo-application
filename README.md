# React-todo-application
### Introductory React JS Project - building a to do application

This was my first project while learning React (popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces). I also learnt basics of HTML and CSS along the way. In this project, emphasis is on functionality rather than look and feel (I have used inline styling at multiple places which is not ideal)

#### FEATURES:
- Ability to add a new task. Each task has a subject, and can have zero or more tags associated with it
- A form captures the subject of the new task, and a comma separated list for the tags
- Each task has a checkbox indicating its status as complete/incomplete
- User can check the checkbox of a task to complete the task
- User can edit a task that is modify subject and add/remove tags after a task has been created
